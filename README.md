# Load Bah

A place for your team to make get requests (easy in curl) to update load bars!

**GET**

```bash
curl -s "$HOST_NAME:$PORT/script_name/current_progress/total_progress"
```

_You can use `-v` if you want verbose output, but typically you want very little output via `-s`_

That's it! :tada:
